The GNNgraph fork of ReadTheDocs tutorial
=========================================

This pre-pre-alpha GitHub template repository includes fictional Python library, GNNgraph.py with some basic Sphinx docs.

GNNgraph itself will be a knowledge-graph of executable Python tutorials for learning about work in graph neural networks.

This repository itself was forked from ... https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/ ... the larger process of how readthedocs.io works and how forkable tutorial templates like this are built is interesting to anyone exploring how knowledge is shared ... even historically, long after after this project is operational.
