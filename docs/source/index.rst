Knowledge Graph Analytics Annotated Tutorials
=============================================

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the principal tool for exploring knowledge graph analytics for the study of how interconnections and fuzzy, imperfect information is efficiently used by billions of actors who participate [often, even typically in an indirect fashion] in internetworked markets for trillions of different products and services. The point of this exploration is to better understand the microfoundations of how information is discovered and assessed by those actors who, although they are aware that the information they are recieving is incomplete and noisy, must form judgements and make purchase decisons, resource/time allocations, employment decisions, health/diet significant lifestyle decisions subject to their own budgetary contraints, apitudes and concerns/fears. 

Humans tend to follow the safety of crowds. Crowds are, of course, far from perfect ... but they may be the most important information that individual humans have. REAL knowledge shared across crowds is built very slowly, much more slowly than an individual can react, based upon the larger crowd's discernment of what actually works in practice and what is mere hype. Thus, individuals with better ability to discern crowd behavior tend to profit enormously by acting ahead of the crowd.
