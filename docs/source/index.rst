Knowledge Graph Analytics Annotated Tutorials
=============================================

.. note::

   This project is STILL BEING INITIALIZED ... pre-pre-alpha ... not even formally in the "pre-alpha" pre-development phase.

Just theorizing about theorizing ...

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can be used for exploring knowledge graph analytics for the study of how interconnections and fuzzy, imperfect information is efficiently processed in crowds of billions. GNNs when used as the basis for simulations can also furnish insights for how networks and internetworks might be designed to be more reliable or offer a better experience for users. 

Humans are social, perhaps tribal creatures who tend toward the excitement and. to so degree, the safety or validation of crowdliness. Crowds can be, of course, far from perfect in different ways ... but the vast array of interconnections yields the combinatorics which constantly generate incredibly wide arrays of choices and variety. People may come together for a happening, a moment or an event like a game or a concert -- but the most interesting part for those attending the event and being in a crowd will generally not be something that is televised.
